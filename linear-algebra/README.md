# Linear-Algebra
Linear Algebra, mathematical discipline that deals with vectors and matrices and, more generally, with vector spaces and linear transformations. Unlike other parts of mathematics that are frequently invigorated by new ideas and unsolved problems, linear algebra is very well understood. Its value lies in its many applications, from mathematical physics to modern algebra and coding theory.

## Point / Vector
Linear algebra usually starts with the study of vectors, which are understood as quantities having both magnitude and direction. Vectors lend themselves readily to physical applications.

### 2-D Vector
In this the point can be represented as vector of size 2.
```p = [x, y]```

Distance of point from origin using pythagoras theorem:

### 3-D Vector
In this the point can be represented as vector of size 3.
```p = [x, y, z]```

### n-D Vector
For representing the point with vector of size n.


## Distance of point from origin
This can be calculated using pythagoras theorem.

## ROW VECTOR
If the vector/ matrix has only 1 row i.e 1 X n dimension then this is row vector.

## COLUMN VECTOR
If the vector/ matrix has only 1 column i.e n X 1 dimension then this is column vector.

## ADDING VECTORS
Let
a = [a1, a2, a3, ..., an]

b = [b1, b2, b3, ..., bn]

then 

a + b = [a1+b1, a2+b2, a3+b3, ..., an+bn]

## MULTIPLICATION VECTORS
There are basically two ways to multiply.
1. Dot Product
2. Cross Product

Let
a = [a1, a2, a3, ..., an]

b = [b1, b2, b3, ..., bn]

then 

a.b = [a1.b1, a2.b2, a3.b3, ..., an.bn]

or this can be written as

[a1, a2, a3, ..., an] (1xn) . [b1, b2, b3, ..., bn] (nx1)

or

row vector . column vector

or

|a| |b| cos(x)

### Typically vector means column vector

## PROJECTION

The projection of a vector on a plane is its orthogonal projection on that plane. The rejection of a vector from a plane is its orthogonal projection on a straight line which is orthogonal to that plane.

## UNIT VECTOR

Unit Vector is represented by the symbol ‘^’, which is called a cap or hat, such as:
A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude, as well as direction. A vector that has a magnitude of 1 is a unit vector. It is also known as Direction Vector.

## EQUATION OF LINE
The general equation of a straight line is y = mx + c, where m is the gradient, and y = c is the value where the line cuts the y-axis. This number c is called the intercept on the y-axis. The equation of a straight line with gradient m and intercept c on the y-axis is y = mx + c.
