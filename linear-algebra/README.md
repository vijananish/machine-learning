# Linear-Algebra
Linear Algebra, mathematical discipline that deals with vectors and matrices and, more generally, with vector spaces and linear transformations. Unlike other parts of mathematics that are frequently invigorated by new ideas and unsolved problems, linear algebra is very well understood. Its value lies in its many applications, from mathematical physics to modern algebra and coding theory.

## Point / Vector
Linear algebra usually starts with the study of vectors, which are understood as quantities having both magnitude and direction. Vectors lend themselves readily to physical applications.

### 2-D Vector
In this the point can be represented as vector of size 2.
```p = [x, y]```

### 3-D Vector
In this the point can be represented as vector of size 3.
```p = [x, y, z]```

### n-D Vector
For representing the point with vector of size n.


## Distance of point from origin
This can be calculated using pythagoras theorem.

## ROW VECTOR
If the vector/ matrix has only 1 row i.e 1 X n dimension then this is row vector.

## COLUMN VECTOR
If the vector/ matrix has only 1 column i.e n X 1 dimension then this is column vector.
